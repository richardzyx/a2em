a2empowerment project weekly research repo

At a2em project, we require each team member to demonstrate a new piece of technology or
tool that he or she was unfamilliar with before. In this way, we stimulate students to 
learn and teach themselves with available resources on the internet and asking for help.

Some examples of the researches are:
elixir
graylog
mocha-as-promised
pm2
seneca.js
Strider
Scala
