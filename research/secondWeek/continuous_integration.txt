Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is a philosophy of programming whereby new changes are committed and integrated into the mainline (read: master branch) frequently (often more than once a day). This ensures that any work will be compatitable with the mainline code, and therefore everyone else's work, and each integration is often accompanied by quality control tests (usually automated) that report the result to the developer so any issues can be resolved quickly and early. This idealogy is not as popular as it used to be due to the various troubles associated with it. One alternative is using a script that runs unit test and merge tests, then if it passes all tests, allow the branch to be merged into master.
